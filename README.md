# SFU Hikers Hub

## Introduction
The SFU Hikers Hub is a centralized digital platform designed for the Simon Fraser Hiking Club. Its purpose is to enhance community engagement, facilitate the organization of events, and provide a dedicated space for members to share and find information about hiking trails, weather updates, and related activities.
